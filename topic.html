            <h2>What is an Artist Residency?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>An artist residency is an opportunity provided by a host organisation that enables a guest artist to work in a new environment, often away from the restrictions and pressures of their everyday lives. Artist residencies are about providing the time and space for a guest artist to develop work and creatively explore new ideas.

            <br>
            <h2>Why Are They Important?</h2> 
            <br>
            <p>Art residencies provide opportunities for artists to connect with other creative individuals, and create work they wouldn't have created otherwise.</p>

            <p>The Gullkistan residency is located in a quiet village by the Laugarvatn Lake with a view of the Hekla volcano.
            <br><br>
            The main objective of Gullkistan is to provide a home and workspace for creative people of all professions in an international community. Surrounded by the sublime nature of south Iceland where they can work on their ideas and become a part of Icelandic culture locally and in a wider spectrum as each one of them prefers.
            <br><br>
            Artists often take part in local community activities and occasionally they finish their stay with a public event sharing their work and experience.</p>
