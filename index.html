                <h3>About Iceland</h3>
                <p>Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields. Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of the population lives in the capital, Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal power and is home to the National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland's Viking history.</p>

                <h3>Reykjavík</h3>
                <p>The capital, Reykjavík (“Bay of Smokes”), is the site of the island's first farmstead and is a thriving city, handsome in aspect and cosmopolitan in outlook. Other major population centres are Akureyri, on the north-central coast; Hafnarfjördhur, on the southwestern coast; and Selfoss, in the southern lowlands.</p>

                <h3>The Land</h3>
                <p>Glacier ice and cooled lava each cover approximately one-tenth of the country's total area. The glaciers are a reminder of Iceland's proximity to the Arctic Circle, which nearly touches its northernmost peninsula. The area covered by Vatnajökull (Vatna Glacier), the country's largest, is equal to the combined total area covered by all the glaciers on the continent of Europe. <br><br>The volcanoes, reaching deep into the unstable interior of the Earth, are explained by the fact that Iceland is located on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is estimated that since the year 1500 about one-third of the Earth's total lava flow has poured out of the volcanoes of Iceland.</p>

                <h3>The Flag</h3>
                <p>It was designed by Matthias Thordarson. The colours have no official symbolism but one popular modern interpretation is that they represent the three elements that created the island: fire, ice and water. The combination of the traditional Icelandic colours blue and white with red reflects historical links with Norway.</p>
